## Reference

The name `Sea Kayak` is in reference to the [sea kayak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_kayak), a type of [kayak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayak) designed for [paddling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddling) over large bodies of water. Specifically, the name for this project came to me after watching [Beau Miles](https://www.youtube.com/@BeauMiles)' 2017 6-part series [Bass by Kayak](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXoBa_nJj5lWtT6DsttZ5le3LxlnrBkjm&feature=shared).

`Sea Kayak` takes great inspiration from [The Forest](https://theforest.link/).
